# day 2
Today I followed several guides to try to implement peer2peer connection between the tablet and the phone. This was quite a challenge, but in the end I managed to get a list of available devices.

# day 3
Today I tried to make an app that runs on the tablet of Pepper. I 'robotified' a new application (meaning it is compatible with the robot SDK's), but the tablet of the robot was not connectable. I searched all fora on this issue, but I couldn't fix it. I'm in the process of posting a question on the softbank forums, but my account still has to be approved. In the meantime I will create a direct connection to the Pepper robot, without use of the tablet.
