This document represents a small style guide, which will serve as a guideline for all Java code in this project. Inspired by the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.1-braces)


- Braces: no line break before the opening brace
- line break after the opening brace
- line break before the closing brace.
- line break after the closing brace, only if that brace terminates a statement or terminates the body of a method, constructor, or named class. For example, there is no line break after the brace if it is followed by else or a comma
- Indentation: Four spaces per indentation layer
- One statement per line
- Enter a space after for/if/while etc.
- Variable declaration: one variable per declaration
- Comments: Above functions/classes etc. use, starting with a capital letter and ending with a period:   
```
/**
 * Comment.
 */
```
- In a function use `// comment` without capital letter and no period
- In function: max 2 comment lines
- Class names: UpperCamelCase
- Method names: lowerCamelCase
- Variable names: with_underscore
- Constants: CAPITALS_WITH_UNDERSCORE
- Everything in English
